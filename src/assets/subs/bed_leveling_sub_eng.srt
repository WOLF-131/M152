00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Here I show how to level my 3D printer.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This means that the print area is straight to the print head.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
There are printers that can do this automatically.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
However, I have to do it manually,

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that means move the print head manually.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
However, I have found a program on the Internet

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
which automatically moves to all corners

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
then to the center

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
and always pauses in between to level the print area.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I have now started the program

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and you can see that the print head moves to the start.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
As soon as the printhead is in the first corner,

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
you can take a Post-It and slide it underneath.

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The goal is to feel a slight resistance.

15
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
If this is not the case you can turn

16
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 the lower screw of the corners

17
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:48,000
until you can feel this slight resistance.

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Once the first corner is done, 

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
you can continue to run the program.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The print head automatically goes to the next corner

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
where you can repeat the same thing

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
until you can feel a slight resistance with the Post-It.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
As soon as the first two pages are done 

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
you can  level the two opposite sides too.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Then the printer moves to the center

26
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
where you can repeat the same thing again.

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
In my case you can see that you can't get the Post-It under it,

28
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
that means you have to do again at the 2nd pass

29
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and loosen the corners a bit.

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
In the 2nd pass you can repeat the same thing

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and it is particularly noticeable, 

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that the lower right corner is very strongly tightened

33
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
which means that it was adjusted too much.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Such inaccuracies can be corrected in the 2nd pass.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and as soon as all corners are ready

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
the printer goes back to the start

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and you can start printing.
